# James Translator

Our influence has spread far and wide in the past decade, but alas, other countries are still hard-set on censoring us and all things James-related. We must rise up! I have thus created this translator to translate from one of our official languages to English and back.

NOTE - As the official Jamish language is documented, this project may extend to cover standard Jamish as well.


It is sadly currently 30 minutes to 02:00, so y'all will js have to build from source until I make different executables. Sorry!
