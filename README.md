# James Translator

Our influence has spread far and wide in the past decade, but alas, other countries are still hard-set on censoring us and all things James-related. We must rise up! I have thus created this translator to translate from one of our official languages to English and back.

NOTE - As the official Jamish language is documented, this project may extend to cover standard Jamish as well.


As it turns out btw, Rust is a pain in the ass to compile to other operating systems. I can try to build it again later, but build from source if you can rn, congrats if you have an aarch64 chip w/ an apple computer bc that's the only executable i made lol
